# COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of COVID-19 clinical trials. The dataset contains details about various trials conducted globally, including their status, study type, locations, and sponsors. The goal is to clean, explore, and visualize the data to gain insights into COVID-19 research trends.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **File Name**: COVID_clinical_trials_cleaned.csv
- **Source**: Clinical trial databases
- **Columns Included**:
  - `Study ID`: Unique identifier for each clinical trial
  - `Title`: Name of the clinical study
  - `Status`: Status of the trial (Completed, Ongoing, Terminated, etc.)
  - `Phase`: Phase of the clinical trial (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
  - `Study Type`: Observational or Interventional
  - `Start Date`: Date when the trial started
  - `Completion Date`: Expected or actual completion date

  - `Sponsor`: Organization conducting the trial

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicate entries, handled missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution of trials across different phases.
  - Trends in study completion and initiation dates.
  - Geographical distribution of trials.
  - Leading sponsors conducting COVID-19 trials.
- **Visualization**: Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to illustrate trends.
